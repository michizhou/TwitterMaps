# TwitterMaps
Submission for HoyaHacks 2018

### Inspiration
We wanted to create a tool that could inspect communities around a user and show them a visualized interpretations of the ideas that surround them.

### What it does
Using Android as our platform, we scape Twitter data with respect to user locality to display word cloud pins on the map. Upon inspecting these the app opens to a fragment that displays the word map in greater scale, sentiment analysis of this word map, important relations and entities within this community as well as keywords that stand up. We intend to neatly display this information.

### How we built it
We built it using the Android Studio platform.

### Challenges we ran into
One of our teammates did not show up and the other one got sick and left. While I think we could take on the challenge, it was too much work to implement all the features we wanted to during the amount of time.

### What we learned
Never use gzip as a protocol for REST transportation.

### What's next for Twordle
Give the user fine grained access tools to investigate the map. For example, this could be giving sliders and other information to change radius, location, important features. Moreover, we intend the user to authenticate with Twitter to give real time comparisons to the user's tweets amongst his/her's surround community.
